Bubble Sort
Implement the bubbleSort method that sorts an input integer array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

Iterate through the input array from the last index to the first index (excluding the first index).

For each index i, iterate through the array from the first index up to index i-1 (inclusive).

Compare the element at the current index j with the element at the next index j+1.

If the element at index j is greater than the element at index j+1, swap the two elements.

After all iterations, the input array will be sorted in ascending order.




This method will be written in the same class as the main method so it will be static.  For more information on static methods click on "Hints."
