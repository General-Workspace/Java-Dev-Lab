Insertion Sort
Implement the insertionSort method that sorts an input integer array using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

Iterate through the input array from the second index to the last index (inclusive).

Store the element at the current index i in a temporary variable temp.

Initialize a new index variable j as i - 1.

Run a while loop as long as j is greater than or equal to 0, and the element at index j is greater than temp.

Shift the element at index j to the right by one position (assign it to index j+1).

Update the element at index j with the value of temp.

Decrement j.

After all iterations, the input array will be sorted in ascending order.



This method will be written in the same class as the main method so it will be static.  For more information on static methods click on "Hints."
