Selection Sort
Implement the selectionSort method that sorts an input integer array using the Selection Sort algorithm.

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

Iterate through the input array from the first index to the second last index (inclusive).

Assume the current index i is the index of the minimum element.

For each index i, iterate through the array from the index i+1 to the last index (inclusive).

Compare the element at the current index j with the element at the assumed minimum index.

If the element at index j is less than the element at the assumed minimum index, update the minimum index to j.

After the inner loop, if the assumed minimum index is not equal to the current index i, swap the elements at the minimum index and the current index i.

After all iterations, the input array will be sorted in ascending order.



This method will be written in the same class as the main method so it will be static.  For more information on static methods click on "Hints."
