Pivot
Implement the pivot method that takes an integer array, a pivotIndex, and an endIndex as input and rearranges the elements of the array around the pivot element, which is the element at the pivotIndex.

The method should return the new pivot index after rearrangement.

Return type: int



The method should perform the following tasks:

Initialize a swapIndex variable with the value of pivotIndex.

Iterate through the array from pivotIndex + 1 to endIndex (inclusive) with an index i. a. If the element at index i is less than the pivot element (element at pivotIndex), increment the swapIndex, and then swap the elements at index i and swapIndex using a swap method.

After iterating through the array, swap the pivot element with the element at swapIndex.

Return the updated value of swapIndex after rearrangement.




This method will be written in the same class as the main method so it will be static.  For more information on static methods click on "Hints."
