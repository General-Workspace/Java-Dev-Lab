Quick Sort
Create a quickSortHelper method within a sorting class that takes an integer array, a left index, and a right index as input and recursively sorts the array using the quick sort algorithm.

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

Check if left is less than right; if not, return without performing any operation.

Call the pivot method (described in a previous problem statement) with the array, left, and right as arguments to find the new pivot index after rearrangement.

Recursively call quickSortHelper with the array, left, and the updated pivotIndex - 1 as arguments.

Recursively call quickSortHelper with the array, the updated pivotIndex + 1, and right as arguments.




This method will be written in the same class as the main method so it will be static.  For more information on static methods click on "Hints."
