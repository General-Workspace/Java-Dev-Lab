DLL: Constructor
Design a class called DoublyLinkedList that represents a doubly linked list.

The class should have the following attributes and methods:

Attributes:

head: a Node object that represents the first node in the doubly linked list.

tail: a Node object that represents the last node in the doubly linked list.

length: an integer representing the number of nodes in the doubly linked list.



Inner class Node:

value: an integer representing the value of the node.

next: a Node object representing the next node in the doubly linked list.

prev: a Node object representing the previous node in the doubly linked list.

A constructor that accepts an integer value as an argument and initializes the value attribute.



Methods:

Constructor DoublyLinkedList: a constructor that accepts an integer value as an argument, initializes a new Node object called newNode with the given value, sets both the head and tail attributes of the list to the newNode, and initializes the length attribute to 1.
