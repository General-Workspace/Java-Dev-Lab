Graph: Add Edge
Implement the addEdge method for the Graph class that adds an edge between two vertices in the graph's adjacency list.

Return type: boolean



The method should perform the following tasks:

Check if both vertex1 and vertex2 are present in the adjList HashMap.

If both vertices are present, add vertex2 to the value list of vertex1 and vertex1 to the value list of vertex2 in the adjList.

Return true to indicate that the edge was added successfully.

If either vertex1 or vertex2 is not present, return false to indicate that the edge was not added.
