Graph: Add Vertex
Implement the addVertex method for the Graph class that adds a vertex to the graph's adjacency list.

Return type: boolean



The method should perform the following tasks:

Check if the vertex is already present in the adjList HashMap.

If it is not present, add the vertex to the adjList with an empty ArrayList<String> as its value.

Return true to indicate that the vertex was added successfully.

If the vertex is already present, return false to indicate that the vertex was not added.
