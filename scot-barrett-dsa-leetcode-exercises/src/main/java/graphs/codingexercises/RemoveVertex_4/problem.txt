Graph: Remove Vertex
Implement the removeVertex method for the Graph class that removes a vertex and all its associated edges from the graph's adjacency list.

Return type: boolean



The method should perform the following tasks:

Check if the vertex is present in the adjList HashMap.

If the vertex is not present, return false to indicate that the vertex was not removed.

If the vertex is present, iterate through its value list (i.e., its neighbors) in the adjList.

For each neighbor, remove the vertex from the neighbor's value list in the adjList.

Remove the vertex from the adjList HashMap.

Return true to indicate that the vertex was removed successfully.
