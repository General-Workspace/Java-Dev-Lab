HT: Keys
Implement the keys method for the HashTable class that retrieves all the keys in the hash table and returns them as an ArrayList.

Return type: ArrayList



The method should perform the following tasks:

Create a new ArrayList<String> called allKeys.

Iterate through the dataMap array using a for loop.

For each index, create a temporary Node variable and assign it to the current array element.

Iterate through the linked list at the current index using a while loop.

Add the key of the current node to the allKeys ArrayList.

Move on to the next node in the linked list.

Return the allKeys ArrayList.
