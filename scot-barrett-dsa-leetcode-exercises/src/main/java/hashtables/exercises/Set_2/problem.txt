HT: Set
Implement the set method for the HashTable class that stores a key-value pair in the hash table.

If the key already exists, update the associated value (this part is different than what was shown in the video).

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

Accept a string key and an integer value as arguments.

Calculate the index for the given key using the hash function.

Create a new Node with the given key and value.

Check if the dataMap array at the calculated index is empty (null).

If it is empty, assign the new node to the array at the calculated index.

If the array at the calculated index is not empty, iterate through the linked list at the index.

Check if the key of the current node is the same as the given key.

If it is the same, update the value of the current node by adding the new value.

If it is not the same and the current node is the last node in the linked list, add the new node to the list.
