Heap: Insert
Implement the insert method in the Heap class.

The Heap class represents a max heap, a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node.

The Heap class currently has several helper methods:

getHeap that returns a new list containing all elements of the heap,

leftChild that returns the index of the left child of a node at a given index,

rightChild that returns the index of the right child of a node at a given index,

parent that returns the index of the parent of a node at a given index,

swap that swaps the elements at two given indices in the heap.



The insert method should add a new integer value to the heap while maintaining the max heap property. In other words, after insertion, each parent node (including the newly inserted element) should be greater than or equal to its child nodes.

The insert method should work as follows:

Add the new value to the end of the heap (the next available position in the complete binary tree).

Compare the inserted element with its parent. If the inserted element is greater than its parent, then swap the element with its parent.

Continue this process until the max heap property is restored (i.e., the parent is greater than its children).



Utilize the parent and swap helper methods in your implementation.
