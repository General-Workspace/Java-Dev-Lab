/*
No. 6
LL: Get
Implement a method called get that retrieves a node from the linked list by its index.

Return type: Node



The method should perform the following tasks:

Accept an integer index as an argument, which will be the index of the node to be retrieved.

If the index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the linked list, return null.

Create a temporary Node object called temp and set it to the current head node.

Iterate through the linked list by updating temp to its next node until the desired index is reached.

Return the node located at the specified index.
