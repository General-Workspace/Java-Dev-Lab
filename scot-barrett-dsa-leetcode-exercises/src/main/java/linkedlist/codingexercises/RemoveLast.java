LL: Remove Last
Implement a method called removeLast that removes the last node from the linked list.

Return type: Node (we are returning the Node that is being removed)



The method should perform the following tasks:

If the length of the linked list is 0, return null.

Create two variables that can point to a Node , temp and pre, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

Traverse the linked list until temp.next is null, performing the following tasks during traversal:

Update pre to point to the current temp node.

Update temp to point to the next node in the linked list.

After traversal, set the tail pointer to pre.

Set the next attribute of the tail node to null.

Decrement the length attribute of the list by 1.

If the length of the linked list becomes 0 after removing the last node, set both the head and tail pointers to null.

Return the removed node (pointed to by temp).
