LL: Remove First
Implement a method called removeFirst that removes the first node from the linked list and returns it.

Return type: Node (the node that is removed)



The method should perform the following tasks:

If the length of the linked list is 0, return null.

Create a temporary Node object called temp and set it to the current head node.

Update the head pointer of the list to point to the next node in the list.

Set the next attribute of temp to null.

Decrement the length attribute of the list by 1.

If the length of the list becomes 0 after removing the first node, set the tail pointer to null.

Return the removed temp node.
