rBST: Contains
Implement the rContains method in the BinarySearchTree class.

The rContains method is a recursive method designed to search for a specific integer value in the binary search tree (BST). It checks if the given value exists in the BST and returns a boolean indicating the presence of that value.

The rContains method consists of two parts. The public part of the method (provided) public boolean rContains(int value) takes the value to be searched as a parameter.

It calls the private part of the method private boolean rContains(Node currentNode, int value) with the root of the BST and the search value as arguments.

Here is the logic you need to implement:

If the currentNode is null, it means we have traversed the tree without finding the value. In this case, return false.

If the value of the currentNode equals the search value, it means we have found the value in the tree. In this case, return true.

If the search value is less than the value of the currentNode, continue the search on the left subtree of the currentNode. This is because, in a BST, values less than a node's value are placed in the left subtree.

If the search value is greater than the value of the currentNode, continue the search on the right subtree of the currentNode. This is because, in a BST, values greater than a node's value are placed in the right subtree.
