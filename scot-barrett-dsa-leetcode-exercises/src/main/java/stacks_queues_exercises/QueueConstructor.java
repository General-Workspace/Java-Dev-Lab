Queue: Constructor
Create a Queue class that represents a queue data structure using nodes.



Implement the constructor and instance variables as follows:

Create a private instance variable first that will store a reference to the first node in the queue.

Create a private instance variable last that will store a reference to the last node in the queue.

Create a private instance variable length that will store the current length of the queue.

Create a nested Node class with an integer value and a reference to the next Node in the queue.

Implement a constructor for the Queue class that takes an integer value as an argument, creates a new Node with the given value, and initializes the first, last, and length instance variables.
