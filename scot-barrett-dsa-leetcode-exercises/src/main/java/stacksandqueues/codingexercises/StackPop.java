Stack: Pop
Implement a pop method that removes and returns the top node from the stack.

Return type: Node (the node that was popped from the stack)



The method should perform the following tasks:

If the height of the stack is 0, return null.

Store the current top node in a temporary variable called temp.

Update the top attribute to point to the next node in the stack.

Set the next attribute of the temp node to null to disconnect it from the stack.

Decrement the height attribute of the stack by 1.
