BST: Insert
Implement the insert method that adds a new node to the tree.

Return type: boolean



The method should perform the following tasks:

Create a new Node object called newNode with the given integer value.

If the root node is null, set the root to the newNode and return true.

Create a temporary node called temp and set it to the root node.

Use a while loop to traverse the tree:

If the newNode value is equal to the temp node value, return false (no duplicates allowed).

If the newNode value is less than the temp node value:

If the left child of temp is null, set the left child to newNode and return true.

Otherwise, set temp to its left child.

If the newNode value is greater than the temp node value:

If the right child of temp is null, set the right child to newNode and return true.

Otherwise, set temp to its right child.
