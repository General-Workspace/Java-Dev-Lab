BST: Contains
Implement the contains method that checks if a node with a given value exists in the tree.

Return type: boolean



The method should perform the following tasks:

If the root node is null, return false.

Create a temporary node called temp and set it to the root node.

Use a while loop to traverse the tree:

If the given value is less than the temp node value, set temp to its left child.

If the given value is greater than the temp node value, set temp to its right child.

If the given value is equal to the temp node value, return true.

If the loop exits without finding a match, return false.
