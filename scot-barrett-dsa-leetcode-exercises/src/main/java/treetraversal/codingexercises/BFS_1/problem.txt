BST: Breadth First Search (BFS)
Create a BFS method within a BinaryTree class that performs a breadth-first search traversal of the tree and returns an ArrayList of the visited nodes' values in the order they were visited.

Return type:  ArrayList<Integer>



The method should perform the following tasks:

Initialize currentNode as the root of the tree.

Create a queue of Node objects named queue using a LinkedList.

Create an ArrayList of Integers named results to store the visited nodes' values.

Add the currentNode to the queue.

Use a while loop to iterate until the queue is empty: a. Remove the first element from the queue and set currentNode to the removed element. b. Add the value of currentNode to the results ArrayList. c. If currentNode has a left child, add it to the queue. d. If currentNode has a right child, add it to the queue.

Return the results ArrayList.
