BST: DFS InOrder
Create a DFSInOrder method within a BinaryTree class that performs a depth-first search (in-order traversal) of the tree and returns an ArrayList of the visited nodes' values in the order they were visited.

Return type: ArrayList<Integer>



The method should perform the following tasks:

Create an ArrayList of Integers named results to store the visited nodes' values.

Define an inner class called Traverse that takes a Node called currentNode as a parameter:

If currentNode has a left child, create a new Traverse object with the left child as the argument.

Add the value of currentNode to the results ArrayList.

If currentNode has a right child, create a new Traverse object with the right child as the argument.

Create a new Traverse object with the root of the tree as the argument.

Return the results ArrayList.



I have also provided an alternative solution in the "Solution Explanation" section that employs a separate recursive helper method rather than using an inner class.
